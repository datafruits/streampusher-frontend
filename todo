Streampusher 2

- [ ] drag and drop media upload is not consistently working for me, but the +add upload works fine. I can edit the uploaded file once (change title, change associated image, etc)
- [x] after the first edit, if I try and edit again, it doesn't show the image or other fields to change, does still show the title text field, but after "artwork" there's nothing. and no buttons under that, so no chance to submit changes.
- [ ] on the media list, the images / media avatars have always been a bit unreliable, but now they dont' seem to update at all
- [x] still on the media page, the "playlists" pulldown doesn't automatically retract when the playlist is selected, but can be manually retracted with the up arrow (maybe by design? different mechanism from old version though)
- [ ] the scaling of the field that shows playlist entries seems to be inconsistent, sometimes that column was invisible but would appear when more items added to the playlist. seems to disappear sometimes on playlist selection, even if the playlist is populated

- [ ] for housekeeping, would it be possible for you to give me permission to delete my old broadcasts from the media server? it gets a bit cluttered, esp since the broadcast images don't always show which is which...
